# Maya-Python-For-Noobs-Course
Python scripts for Maya python course by Josh Sobel

In December 2020, I took an online course hosted by Josh Sobel called "Maya Python for Noobs" (https://gumroad.com/l/mayaPythonForNoobs). I took notes and followed along with him as he taught Python essentials for Maya, and taught how to write scripts such as an auto-rig, a versioning tool, a batch connection tool, and a UI tool. These scripts are the result of my following along the videos and taking notes in the form of comments.
